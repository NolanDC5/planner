# planner
Deployed URL:

This application I created a scheduler/planner for the typical work day. The scheduler has 8 segments one for each hour 9-5.
The hours will show a different color depending on where it is in relation to your day. 
We have three different colors...
<ul>Grey for the past as its behind you don't need to worry about it anymore.</ul>
<ul>Red for the current hour as it takes priortity for what needs to get done</ul>
<ul>Green for the future as it brings good things to come. </ul>
